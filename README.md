### Background

_Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. [More..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)_

### Gameplay
In this game, you have to play against computer. The first chance is always given to the user. By inputing the coordinate you have to pick the position in the tic-tac-toe board.
Let's consider a board:
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 So, if you want to pick the position 1, the you need to input 0 0.
 For position 2 --> 0 1
 For position 2 --> 0 2
 For position 2 --> 1 0
 For position 2 --> 1 1
 For position 2 --> 1 2
 For position 2 --> 2 0
 For position 2 --> 2 1
 For position 2 --> 2 2
